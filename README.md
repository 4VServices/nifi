# MarkLogic NiFi Incubator

* This incubator has new processors and some fixes or extensions to core MarkLogic processors.
* This incubator is "ahead" of the supported MarkLogic NiFi product
* This incubator is not supported by MarkLogic Support, so issues should be resolved here if they are with the incubator, vs issues with core supported processors which should be reported to MarkLogic Support

* Please use the official [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/) release when deploying NiFi.

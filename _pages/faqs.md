## MarkLogic NiFi Bundle FAQs

### What version of the MarkLogic NiFi Bundle should I use?

We use a version pattern that mimics the version of NiFi that a MarkLogic NiFi Bundle is built against. If you are using NiFi 1.7.1, you should use the latest 1.7.1.x NiFi bundle. If you are using NiFi 1.8.0, you should use the latest 1.8.0.x NiFi bundle.

As far as the NiFi API compatibility between versions allows, the latest `<NiFi Version>.x` NiFi bundles will have a common code-base and functionality.

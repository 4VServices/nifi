# MarkLogic NiFi

With Apache NiFi, you can use out-of-the-box processors to create data flows from relational databases such as MySQL or Postgres, Apache Kafka data streams and other sources in the Hadoop ecosystem, and many other data sources. If a processor doesnâ€™t exist, you can build your own or you can create templates for common data flow patterns, then publish and share them for others to benefit and collaborate.

The MarkLogic NiFi bundle simplifies integrating MarkLogic into your data management and orchestration strategy.
